# Unhandled Database Error in Express Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  unhandled errors during database operations within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:** The original code lacks proper error handling when fetching user data from the database. A database error could cause the server to crash or return a generic 500 error, making debugging difficult.

**Solution:** The solution implements robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle potential database errors, returning more informative error responses to the client.
